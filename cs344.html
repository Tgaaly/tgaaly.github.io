<font color="black" size="4">Fast Fourier: </br>
I see I was a little quick with the FFT. As is, it would devastate you in the exam, so I will see what we can do. In any case, matrix operations, arithmetic complexiity (number of arithmetic operations) are a must to know. Try to catch up with them (you need them for one of the homeworks, anyway). We shall also hover over them (and FFT) in the next class before going on. Stay tuned. MS</font>

STUDY GUIDE FOR MIDTERM II
</br>
</br>
I will clone the problems for Mid2 (foreseeably 4-6 problems) from the following list of problems in the book. The clones will not be identical twins of the problems in the book, but please bring your book to the exam, because there could be references to its pages. For your convenience I classified the problems according to the aspects along which I plan to clone them. Any problem in Mid2 will belong to the one of the following 11 categories:
</br>
I. Run a known algorithm on some given input instance and (possibly) answer simple questions about the instance or the algorithm. There will be at least one such problem on the exam (maybe two):
</br> 
3.2  3.3   3.4  4.1  4.2  5.1  5.2
</br>
II. Find the right algorithm (among the ones you have learned) for a problem, and give an explanation of how you want to apply it in the given situation:
</br> 
3.8
</br>
III. Prove some simple facts about graphs:
</br> 
3.6  5.4  5.10
</br>
IV. Solve a very simple task in linear (or nearly linear time).  For the solution you  do not necessarily need to apply any algorithm you have learned about:
</br> 
3.5  3.9  5.3
</br> 
V. [my favorite type] Design an algorithm for a problem, where the solution requires applying a known algorithm in clever ways, or it requires modifying a known algorithm. (sometimes both types of solution exist, sometimes only one):
</br> 
3.11  3.22  3.24  4.3  4.14  4.15  4.20  5.7
</br> 
VI. Make simple observations about known algorithms:
</br> 
3.12
</br> 
VII. Writing useful previsit(), postvisit() routines for explore/DFS
</br> 
3.25
</br> 
VIII. Understand equivalence relations
</br> 
3.29  3.31
</br> 
IX. Problems that require ingenuity
</br> 
3.23  4.5  4.7  4.11  4.17 
</br> 
X. Do modification of known algorithms work? Do they work on select illegal inputs? If not, why not.
</br> 
4.8  4.9
</br> 
Xi. Construct worst case input for known algorithms:
</br> 
5.12

Homework 7 (re-post)</br>

1. Let G be a directed graph on n nodes. Assume that its meta-graph has
k edges, and its number of strongly connected components with size 1 is
s. Prove that that G must have at least n+k-s edges.

Homework 8</br>
1. Let G be a DAG. Assume that we topologically sort the nodes of G, and then relabel them accordingly (thus the node that is first in the topological order gets label 1, the next gets label 2,etc., and the last gets label n).</br>
Let P be a directed path in G. Prove or disprove the following statement: If we run the BFS on G using these new labels, then the BFS will discover the edges of P in the order in which the occur in P 
(that is, the BFS will discovers the first edge of P before discovering any other edge of P, etc.)

2. What if we replace BFS with DFS in the above problem (keeping the rest the same)?

2. Construct the minimum weight spanning tree (and compute its total cost) of the graph to exercise 5.1 when the weights are modified as follows:
</br>

    a.)  the weights are the squares of the weights given by the book (3 -> 9, etc.)

</br>

    b.) the weights are negatives of the weights given by the book   (3 -> -3, etc.)

</br></br>

3. Which two of the three trees you have constructed (when you disregard the weights) are identical and why?

</br></br>
 

Definition: total cost = sum of the weights on the edges of the spanning tree.

Homework 10</br></br>
In a linguistic conference Dr Joseph Smith has recommended a measure for the distance between two words, v and w, as follows:
  

</br></br>
We associate a cost measure to any letter-alteration as folows:
  

</br></br>
If a vowel is deleted, it costs 3    (boat -> bat)</br>
If a vowel is inserted, it costs 3      (hill -> hilal)</br>
If a vowel is changed to another vowel, it costs 2    (hot -> hit)</br>
If a consonant  is deleted, it costs 2      (trace -> race)</br>
If a consonant  is inserted, it costs 2     (rain -> ratin)</br>
If a consonant is changed to another consonant, it costs 1     (shore -> snore)</br>
(a consonant cannot be changed to a vowel or vice versa)
  

</br></br>
Any word can be changed into any other by performing a sequence of alterations, where every alteration comes from the above list.
  

</br></br>
The total cost of an alteration-sequence is the sum of the costs of the individual alterations in the sequence.The distance between v and w is minimum total cost that incurs when we alter v to w, 
  

</br></br>
(trace -> race -> bace -> bac -> bat ) costs 2+ 1 + 3 + 1=7. Can you do it cheaper? (no)  The distance between "trace" and  "bat" is 7.
  

</br></br>
Design a dynamic programming algorithm for Dr J.S. that takes v and w as it input, and computes the distance between the two words.
 

</br></br>
